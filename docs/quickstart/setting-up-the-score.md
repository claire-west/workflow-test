# Setting Up the Score

The time axis displays time signature and tempo markers above the arrangement and piano roll.

To modify a marker, double click on it. To delete a marker (not including markers at measure 1), right click on it and select "Delete".

New markers of either type can be added by right clicking along the time axis. Tempo markers can also be added by double-clicking along the time axis.

Tempo markers can only be created at quarter-measure intervals, and time signature changes can only occur at the start of a measure.
