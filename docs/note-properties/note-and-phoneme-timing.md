# Note and Phoneme Timing

Note Timing properties allow you to adjust the distribution or duration of phonemes within a note, or entire notes relative to their neighbors.

## Note Offset
The note offset slider will move the beginning of the selected note(s) earlier or later by up to 0.1 second, and will adjust the neighboring phoneme timing appropriately.

    It is normal for a note's first phoneme to begin before the note itself. This is done to replicate how human vocalists transition between lyrics.

## Phoneme Timing
Default phoneme timing is determined based on the phoneme's type (vowel, stop, fricative, etc). The timing distribution of phonemes within a note (and relative to its neighbors) can be modified between 20% and 180% of this default.
