An unofficial user manual for Synthesizer V Studio.

### Dev Environment
Development setup is simple:

1. Run `setup.sh` to install prerequisites (may need to run with `sudo`)
2. Run `mkdocs serve` in the root directory
3. Navigate to http://localhost:8000

This works with WSL, so there is no plan for a Windows setup.
